Welcome to XMLCurses's Documentation!
=====================================

Thank you for using xmlcurses, a python library that makes
it easy to use the curses module in python by letting
the programmer describe the desired curses windows' layout
using XML. The xmlcurses module defines several simple
python routines that parse the XML files, draw the described
windows on terminal, populate them with data, wait
for user input, and do many other useful tasks.

I advise you to start with :doc:`intro/intro` page to get
an idea of the basic concepts and use cases of xmlcurses
library. Next, you can check the :doc:`examples/examples` page
to see snippets of python code that use xmlcurses
routines, along with xml layout examples.

The :doc:`tutorial/tutorial` page helps you build an xmlcurses-based
python program step by step. Finally, :doc:`xml/xml` and
:doc:`classes/classes` enumerate all XML tags and python
classes defined by xmlcurses library.
