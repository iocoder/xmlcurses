Code Examples
=============

The source code tree for xmlcurses contains several
code examples under `examples/` directory. This section
illustrates the examples, which are fairly easy
and do not really need any explanation, but I know
that some people are too stupid and they need me
setup this Sphinx thing and write down all this
documentation to be perceived as a good Software
Engineer that documents his/her code, but in reality
they are just very stupid and they can't understand
a piece of simple-as-shit code by themselves.
